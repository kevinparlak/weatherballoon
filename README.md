AERSP 440 - Aerospace Software Engineering project

This project was done by the Blue Coding Team in AERSP 440 as a class project based on the systems engineering process.

Team members include:  Kevin Parlak, Timothy Sam, Evan Kerr, Nawaf Abdullah, Ali Wahab.

This project was implemented in a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B with Raspian operating system.

This code reads and parses GPS data from a GlobalSat BU353S4 USB GPS Receiver which only includes GPGGA NMEA data, reads pressure and temperature data from a BMP280 sensor, takes pictures using the raspicam libraries, utilizes GPIO ports with the wiringPi libraries, and moves servo motors attached to a Pololu Micro Maestro 6-channel USB controller with source code found via the Pololu website.
